## Summary

The project aims to find a possible correlation between economic growth and sports by showing animation of medaling countries in summer Oplympics from 1896 to 2008. The findings is desribed in the attached PDF file.


## Design

Initial Design Decisions: 

Chart type: map chart

Layout: World map

Visual encodings: A choropleth map plot where the color of countries shows the total number range of medals in summer Olympics. If the country has no medal in summer Olympics, the country will be colored grey.

Interaction: The tooltip shows the country name and total number of medals. 

Final Design Decisions:

Chart type: map chart

Layout: World map

Visual encodings: A choropleth map plot where the color of countries shows the total number range of medals in summer Olympics. If the country has no medal in summer Olympics, the country will be colored grey.


Animation: An animation displays how different countries winning medals in summer Olympics changed over the past over 100 years (from 1896 to 2008, to be more specific) by each year when summer Olympics were held. 

 
Interaction: During the animation, the tooltip shows the country name and total number of medals in that year. After the animation, total number of medals for countries would be displayed through different colors. At this time, the tooltip shows the country name and the total number of medal (of all summer Olympics).


## Feedback

Feedback #1: After I showed my initial visualization, a friend of mine told me that it was hard to see the number of medals for different countries in each summer Olympics changed over time. 

Decision: To add animation described in the final design decisions above.

Feedback #2: After I showed my initial visualization, another friend of mine told me that the color of non-medaling countries being yellow is sharp to the eyes.

Decision:  I changed the color of non-medaling countries to grey.


Feedback #3: After I added the tooltip to the animation, another friend of mine told me that it bothered her that after clicking a country, the information about the country and medal number lingered. 

Decision:  I took care of the lingering issue for tooltip.
