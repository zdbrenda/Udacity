Final Design Decisions:

Chart type: map chart

Layout: World map

Visual encodings: A choropleth map plot where the color of countries shows the total number range of medals in summer Olympics. If the country has no medal in summer Olympics, the country will be colored grey.


Animation: An animation displays how different countries winning medals in summer Olympics changed over the past over 100 years (from 1896 to 2008, to be more specific) by each year when summer Olympics were held. 

 
Interaction: During the animation, the tooltip shows the country name and total number of medals in that year. After the animation, total number of medals for countries would be displayed through different colors. At this time, the tooltip shows the country name and the total number of medal (of all summer Olympics).
